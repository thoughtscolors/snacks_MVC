# snacks_MVC

Time to bring it all together! Build a RESTful API according to an MVC architecture for a single resource based on your choosing. For example, if you were going to build an API for a Snack resources your routes might look like:

GET /snacks
GET /snacks/:id
POST /snacks
PUT /snacks/:id
DELETE /snacks/:id
Your resource should have at least four fields. Each resource must, in addition, include an id that is unique across every existing resource.
